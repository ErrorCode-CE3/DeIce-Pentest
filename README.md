Port 80 will be my starting point in my user interface investigation. Port 80 is the HTTP port, this means i can input the IP address in a browser serach box and a website will pop up.

 I will now click on the CLICK HERE link to investigate the website in its entirety for promising information. The link has a section with contact information for various people in the company.

These usernames can be used in brute forcing so we will create a text file of the usernames, in the file i added the first name with the last initial along with the original usernames in to be safe.

Box 1 Metasploit:  <br/>
   
Im going to now attempt to login to the SSH service with the usernames using metasploits ssh login. But before the service is useful I must configure the module

<br />
<br />
In the module input "search ssh_login" | "use 0" | and "show options"

<br />
"set BLANK_PASSWORDS true" | set USERS_AS_PASS true | set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100 | set USERS_FILE /root/users.txt | "show options" to confirm the module is correctly configured.

Run the module. After its done compiling input the ssh login to attempt logging in. In my case I met some resistance. So i had to choose a specific session, using " sessions -i 2"

Attempt login again using ssh bbanter@192.168.1.100. After gaining access use the command "Cat /etc/passwd" it will display whatever is in the directory that it has been directed to

Unizip the rockyou file to allow it to be used with hydra as a passwords list, Uusing the cat rouckyou.txt command I confirm that the correct output is coming from the file

Using hydra i will now look for the password for aadams to further my investigation for the root password. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96101e5f-8a75-444b-93a4-42713818e4e8)

I will now be using the found password for aadams to login using the "ssh addams@192.168.1.100 command" 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d1eaec1-4755-47d2-b9aa-4b0c19466542)

I put the hashes in a text file and use john the ripper on the file to find the password 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4db1030-70b8-44b8-afa3-7b71dc09713b)

I logged into aadams because the user has sudo privileges, then after logging in. I used the sudo  command so that it would prompt me for a password. The password used is the roots password, which allowed me root access.  

Showing I have access to the root account permits completion of box 1!
