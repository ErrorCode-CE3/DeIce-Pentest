Port 80 will be my starting point in my user interface investigation. Port 80 is the HTTP port, this means i can input the IP address in a browser serach box and a website will pop up.

 I will now click on the CLICK HERE link to investigate the website in its entirety for promising information. The link has a section with contact information for various people in the company.

These usernames can be used in brute forcing so we will create a text file of the usernames, in the file i added the first name with the last initial along with the original usernames in to be safe.

Box 1 Metasploit:  <br/>

Im going to now attempt to login to the SSH service with the usernames using metasploits ssh login. 
But before the service is useful I must configure the module

<br />
<br />
In the module input "search ssh_login" | "use 0" | and "show options"
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4085992-c397-4e52-bde0-92c2d4c378f8)
<br />
"set BLANK_PASSWORDS true" | set USERS_AS_PASS true | set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100 | set USERS_FILE /root/users.txt | "show options" to confirm the module is correctly configured.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eb52ade-d2cb-436e-b36a-c22c780c46d2)

Run the module. After its done compiling input the ssh login to attempt logging in. In my case I met some resistance. So i had to choose a specific session, using " sessions -i 2"

The password for bbanter was found with the ssh login, i will now try so login using his credentials.
